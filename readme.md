# Preamble 
Steam is not to blame. <br> 
itch.io is not to blame. <br>

**Collective Shout are scum.** <br>
Anyone who censors the internet is scum.

Global censorship, enacted by an opaque collection of entities, can be set in motion by some nobodies on a pearl-clutching moral crusade under the guise of "think of the children"?

Kindly go fuck yourselves.


# Anyway
The data is awful and was scraped incredibly crudely. I'll update it as I find time. <br>
Much of it came from user-generated collections, so it contains at least a few hundred entries that need manual verification.

I have no interest in hosting a site but I would be very grateful if this information was at all useful to any of the lovely and amazing folks such as:
- https://loop-io.dev/
- ..others? (if youre hosting something public please ping me / open an issue / whatever. I'll put a link here)


Shoutout to:
- archive.org üíô (who had nothing to do with this but I scraped their content relentlessly, sorry!)
- anyone who has ever made a NSFW collection on itch.io over the years ‚ù§Ô∏è
- all the silly people on discord, reddit, and various imageboards sharing their collections :3
